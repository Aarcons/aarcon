                        <p>Stress is something that’s unavoidable these days. As the famous actress-producer, Goldie Hawn once said that “<b>Stress</b> is something that’s created in mind. It’s how we look at things. So our greatest defense against stress is the ability to change our minds, to change our thinking.”</p>
                        <p>For students to share their problems with teachers the pre-requisite is that they should trust their teachers first. And to build this trust the teachers should first reach the hearts of the students. And once that trust is made, then it’s normal for students to come up to teachers and share their issues and problems.</p>
                        <p>Stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues are not unusual amongst students. But during the pandemic, it has become even worse. Unfortunately, home isn’t a safe place for all. So, students with an unhealthy home environment are struggling with the current crisis.</p>
                        <p>Educators have the power to sense student’s well-being. They know their students very well and they can sense the mental health of the student’s through their behavior and activity levels. A lot of students look up to their educators for support and guidance. As they can show them the right path and show them a way to deal with stress and anxiety.</p>
                        <h4><b>Some of the strategies for teachers to help students manage stress and take care of their well-being are given below:</b></h4>
                        <h4><b>1. Create a sense of stability and flexibility:</b></h4>
                        <p>In these tough times,  flexibility is most important, as you can spare some time from your schedule for students and you can set up appointments for students to discuss and solve their anxiety and stress issues. This way you can manage students accordingly.</p>
                        <h4><b>2. Listen and validate honestly:</b></h4>
                        <p>Sometimes all a student wants is to just tell their teachers about their problems and they just want their teachers to listen to them. But in reality, all the adults just want to fix the problem themselves. Sometimes, all you need to do is just acknowledge the student’s problem and just listen to them.</p>
                        <h4><b>3. Encourage students to ask for help:</b></h4>
                        <p>If a student doesn’t ask for help then the teacher would not be able to help them at all as they will not know anything. So, to help a student you must first make trust and relation between yourself and you should encourage the students to ask for help whenever they are in trouble. </p>
                        <h4><b>4. Expect appropriately:</b></h4>
                        <p>Most of the time teachers expect more than what the students can deliver. A teacher should know the capabilities and abilities of your student. And should not expect that the students will perform more than their capabilities.</p>
                        <h4><b>5. Remind them they are not alone:</b></h4>
                        <p>When a student is feeling adversity then it is a teacher’s responsibility to remind the students that they are not alone. They can talk to you and share their feelings with you. Because when adversity feels like a shared experience then we cope better – not only emotionally, but neurologically.</p>
                        <h4><b>6. Keep a personalized approach:</b></h4>
                        <p>Every student learns at a different pace, the same principle applies when they are dealing with trauma. Every student deals with trauma differently. It is the teacher’s duty to identify them and approach them correctly. And if they need professional help in dealing and overcoming the trauma then the educator must guide them to a professional counselor.</p>
                        <h4><b>Some quick tips for in-class activities:</b></h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A teacher should provide information in digestible amounts, one that the students can digest and understand. And it is a teacher’s responsibility to encourage students to clarify their doubts and questions.</li>
                            <li>Encourage students to ask questions in the class and start a healthy discussion about the topic. And encourage them to lead the way in sharing what they do and do not understand.</li>
                        </ul>
